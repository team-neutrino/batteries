# batteries

A repository for data and analysis of battery tests performed by Team Neutrino.

- data/ contains raw and compiled data
- docs/ contains documentation about the batteries and tests
- analysis/ contains analysis of the data
- R/ contains (or will contain) R functions and scripts

We will probably want to work with raw test data files which are currently in
data/tests since these have consistent formatting and have not been messed 
around with by a human.
